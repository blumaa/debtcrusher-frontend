debtCrusher

debtCrusher was created by Aaron Blum in order to address and decrease the massive amount of student loan debt in the United States and around the world. It is an education student loan crowdfunding web application.

Getting Started

Because debtCrusher is hosted on Heroku, it takes a while for Heroku's servers to start up. First, go to https://debt-crusher-frontend.herokuapp.com/. Then wait for the site to time out. Then press refresh. The site should work now.  Feel free to sign up.

What You Can Do

After you sign up and login, you can create a student loan project. If you go to MyProject and click on Connect to Stripe, you can use test data to create your own project. Once you go all the way through the Stripe connection you will be forwarded back to debtCrusher.

Try to back other student's student loan project's on the site. Fill out the funding form. Use Stripe's test credit card info. It is just 4242 4242 4242 42424 04/24 424. Once you click submit you should see the student's debt amount decrease!
